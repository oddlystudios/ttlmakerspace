These beautiful, hand-made writing pens are a result of a combination of techniques, including joinery and turning on the lathe. The end product is a beautiful, completely unique piece that could be a wonderful personal gift for a loved one.

To see the full process, watch this outstanding video by Maker Andrew, who starts with a piece of debris and finishes with the beautiful work you see above.

### To Remember:

- Pen-turning requires a "pen blank" - the metal insert needed
- A pen-drilling vice helps get clean centers for the blank
- Sand your tube inserts for better adhesion
- Insider tip: superglue makes an excellent surface finish
- No lathe? Look to a local makerspace for tools and training!

Hey you. Yes you - if you're inspired to try out making pens like Andrew, you should think about taking the next lathe workshop at the TTLMakerspace!
